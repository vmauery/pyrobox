			description: Allow these management pages to be access from the internet.  This is potentially dangerous and is not recommended except for short periods of time.  If enabled, this feature will time-out after 5 minutes.

			label: Remote management IP address
			description: Only allow this IP address to connect for remote management.  This makes the remote management feature much safer by limiting which machines can connect.

		textbox:
			name: firewall_wan_mgmt_port
			label: Remote management port
			description: Specify which port remote management will be available on.  Common ports are 80, 8000, or 8080 for http or 443 for https.
			default_value: 8080

		textbox:
			name: firewall_dmz_host
			label: DMZ host
			description: This allows a single machine to be allowed into the 'De-militarized Zone'.  This is required for some games and is not recommended unless the machine has its own adequate firewall protection.  Pleast note that with a DMZ host in effect, all incoming connections from the WAN will be routed to that machine, which may interrupt services running on other machines.  It is a much better idea to do individual port forwarding for the ports your game requires that to use DMZ.

			name: firewall_masquerade
			label: IP masquerade
			description: Masquerade is also known as dynamic NAT and recommended for most networks.  The only reason you would not want this is if you have been allocated global IP addresses for all the machines on your internal network.

				on: Enabled

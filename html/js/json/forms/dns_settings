			description: Enabling the DNS server can make for faster domain name lookups because it is a caching name server.  In addition, the DNS server can supply the hostnames for machines on the local network.  When this option is enabled, DHCP clients will use this gateway as their DNS server as well.  Since it is merely a caching name server, at least one upstream server is required.
